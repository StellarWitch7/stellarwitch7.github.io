Heya! I've got some sillies around here. You can [get acquainted](/about.html), take a look at some of my [writings](/writings.html), learn about my current and past [projects](/projects.html), or [get in touch](/contact.html) with me! I'm only a little shy.

If you use [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org) or a similar extension, consider disabling it. It's already dark here!

To refer to this site, you may embed the following HTML:
```html
<a href="https://stellarwitch7.github.io" target="_blank"><img src="https://stellarwitch7.github.io/images/buttons/mine.png" alt="The Starwatch"/></a>
```
Here's what it looks like!
<div class="button-gallery"><a href="/"><img src="/images/buttons/mine.png" alt="The Starwatch"/></a></div>
